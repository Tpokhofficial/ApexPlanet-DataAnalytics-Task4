Task 4 – Hypothesis Testing Report

This task focuses on statistical hypothesis testing to examine differences
in aggression scores between male and female respondents.

Null Hypothesis (H0):
There is no significant difference in aggression scores between male and female respondents.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1):
There is a significant difference in aggression scores between male and female respondents.

An independent samples t-test assuming unequal variances was conducted, as the sample
sizes of male and female respondents were different.

The results show that the mean aggression score for males (M = 2.84) and females (M = 2.92)
does not differ significantly (p = 0.388 > 0.05).

Therefore, the null hypothesis is not rejected.
